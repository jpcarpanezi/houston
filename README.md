1. Generate an authentication private key by running the following command in your terminal:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -N "" -f /data/houston/PrivateKey.pem
```

2. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the provided [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/jpcarpanezi/houston/blob/dev/docker-compose.yaml) template:
   
3. In the docker-compose.yaml file, replace `<host-origin>`, `<postgres-password>`, `<redis-password>`, and `<rabbit-password>` with your desired passwords.
